The [Heath brother's Dan and Chip](http://heathbrothers.com/) have laid out a
simple acronym to apply when presenting an idea that needs to stick. The
acronym is SUCCESS.

[Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others
Die](http://www.amazon.com/Made-Stick-Ideas-Survive-Others/dp/1400064287) is
true to it's title. When presenting ideas we often get caught up in expert
speak, we present the details, the facts, the information but often leave our
audience disengaged and uncertain about our message.

Days, hours or even minutes after we have presented, our audience may struggle
to recall the crux of our message.

Made to Stick takes a look at why some messages stick better than others and
distills the learning's down to the SUCCESS formula. A convenient acronym for
important elements to incorporate into a presentation or writing to ensure that
your key message is understood and stays with the audience long after it was
presented to them.

The SUCCESS acronym stands for:

- **S**imple
- **U**nexpected
- **C**oncrete
- **C**redible
- **E**motional
- **S**tories

_"If you say three things, you are saying nothing"_, _distill the main idea down
to the core compact concept_ and the _Commander's Intent_ are the keys to keeping a
message **Simple**. Avoid conflating a message with multiple arguments and
positions, the simplest proverbs are the most memorable.

Provoke curiosity and avoid the obvious when presenting information or stories
about your idea. It is often the stories or facts that surprise us, that stick
with us. Ensure your message is presented in a way that it is **unexpected**
to the audience.

There is nothing worse than an idea or message that is abstract and
unrelatable. Memorable messages are presented in terms that the audience
understands, they are tangible, descriptive, avoid biases and are unambiguous.
They are **concrete** messages. Ensure your message is concrete for the audience.

Facts and statistics are important. Your message has to be **credible**.
Supported by authorities and anti-authorities. When presenting this
information, avoid presenting just the numbers and information, provide vivid
details, present facts and statistics that are testable by the audience, create
an impact, show underlying relationships and compare data to enhance the
impact. Try and find a statement that fulfills the "Sinatra Test". A statement
such as, _"If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere"_.

An **emotional** link is also important. Avoid provoking the analytical mind.
Appeal to peoples values and self images, use influences in the community and
social aspects to stimulate emotion. People are wired to feel for tangible
things, not facts and figures.

Being able to link it all with a **story** that stimulates the imagination and
provides further context. Allow your audience a way to relate.

By incorporating elements of the SUCCESS method into the presentation of an
idea, you should be left with something that is memorable, something that is
_sticky_. Much of the formula presented by the Heath brothers is backed by
studies in psychology and builds on a lot of other theory done in the subject.
For this reason, I look forward to being able to put it to use soon.
