Dan Pink's book on what motivates us, Drive, has been an insightful read.
Having seen the [RSA Animate video on what motivates us](https://youtu.be/u6XAPnuFjJc)
and his [TED talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation?language=en)
I have already had a small taste of what to expect. The book solidified a lot
his thoughts and research on the topic and I found it quite informative.

His passion and interest in the topic comes out in the book and it has left me
with a good vocabulary on the topic with clear ideas on what to apply in the
future.

The book begins by going over the different forms of motivation that we have
subjected ourselves to over the years. It began with **Motivation 1.0**, our
needs to survive, to eat and provide for our families. As the world developed
the motivation moved towards **Motivation 2.0**, the sticks and carrots era.
In this era, motivation to work was driven by rewards and the fear of punishment or
negative consequences. The last stage, **Motivation 3.0** is where Dan's
hypothesizes the world is moving towards. His thoughts and ideas are well
researched and throughout the book he presents academic studies and mature
advance thinking organizations that posit his claims.

The key takeaways for me where around his discussion on **Motivation 2.0** and
his ideas on what **Motivation 3.0** is. The traditional forms of motivation through
**extrinsic** factors of a title, salary or fear of joblessness can only drive so
much motivation from us. For creative jobs where there is an expectation to do
more than a medial structured repetitive task, this form of extrinsic
motivation is limiting. To truly motivate ourselves we need **intrinsic** forms of
motivation. Internally we all have a drive to do well, to help others and to
create a better world. To tap into these desires we have to ensure that the our
work is structured in a way to allow us **Autonomy**, to find **Mastery** and
have a clear **Purpose**.

By accident, or by purposeful design I can see many of these elements being
present in the organisation I work in. I've had the privilege of experiencing
first hand that if your organisation provides work in a way to give you full
Autonomy to structure, design and complete the work in a way that you feel
comfortable. And provide you with the support, opportunities and time to master
skills you are passionate about. And to make the overall work purposeful with
clear outcomes. **It can set up the whole organisation for success**.

Drive solidified for me and provided a clear explanation for much of what I
have observed and learned working in an organisation that has a culture of
**Autonomy**, **Mastery** and **Purpose**. Having gained a language and body of research on
the topic, I look forward to being able to introduce many of these ideas with
our clients.
