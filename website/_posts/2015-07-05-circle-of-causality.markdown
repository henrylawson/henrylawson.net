In Systems Thinking, a foundational concept is called Circles of Causality.
To define it simply, it is a term to describe that every event or happening in a
system is a **_cause_ and an _effect_, to every action there is a reaction,
to which there is a reaction**.

The understanding that every action causes a reaction forms the basis of
Systems Thinking. The important thing to distinguish though is that the
[reactions of an action are not immediately obvious](

time these subtle reactions can cause very obvious negative or positive
results.

Circles of Causality are typically described as two types of feedback,
[Reinforcing and Balancing Feedback](

of feedback go into a System and can be used to understand its current state.
