In [Are You Fully
Charged?](http://amzn.to/2envlrw)
Tom Rath quotes a study on Pro Social Incentives for teams. I had come across a
similar idea presented before in
[Drive](http://amzn.to/2exCZ6c)
by Dan Pink. My own experiences participating in sporting teams and at
ThoughtWorks further emphasized the argument for it.

When motivating ourselves we are much more incentivised if the reward being
offered for our work benefits others through our giving rather than receiving a
reward ourselves.

From my personal experiences I have found my work to be much more rewarding
when the result of my work allows me to provide a benefit to another person and
not just to myself. That said, I believe that a Pro Social Incentive is most
effective when their is already some baseline of incentive for the individual
already established, i.e. [Maslow's Hierarchy of
Needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs).
