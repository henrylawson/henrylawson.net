Too often when refactoring it can be easy to get carried away trying to
refactor and optimize to a structure that is perfect, expressive, concise and
readable.

The quote above is a good reminder that what we really need to design for is
something that preserves our ability to change it. I have learned this the hard
way. More times than I'd like to admit, I've refactored to a solution that is
more difficult to change than if it was just left untouched.
