To often when refactoring it can be easy to get carried away trying to refactor
and optimize to  structure that is perfect, expressive, concise and readable.

The quote above is a good reminder that while those above items are important
what we really need to design for is something that preserves our ability to
change it, to often I have refactored to a solution that is more difficult to
change then if just left untouched.
