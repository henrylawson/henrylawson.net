[Switch by Chip and Dan
Heath](www.amazon.com/Switch-Change-Things-When-Hard/dp/0385528752) is a book
on influencing and driving changes in behavior. The book uses the metaphor of
an elephant and it's rider. In their metaphor, the rider represents our
logically thinking mind, the elephant our internal _do-what-I-feel_ like
subconscious mind.

The metaphor plays well with itself, a person atop a large animal. It is easy
to imagine our logical mind (the rider) dealing with our sometimes sporadic and
uncontrollable subconscious wanting to do things on a whim or how they were
always done (the elephant).

Chip and Dan break down the process of driving the rider and elephant into
three key steps. **Direct the rider**, **Shape the path** and **Motivate the
elephant**.

**Directing the rider** is about talking to the logically thinking rider and
setting them up to respond to the change. To do this, Chip and Dan recommend
you look at the problem objectively and identify the bright spots, find the
areas that are doing it the right way. Script the critical moves for the rider
by limiting options and making it easy to do the right thing and pointing the
rider to the destination by making it clear what success will look like.

**Shaping the path** looks at building successful habits, rallying the herd and
creating an environment that is self perpetuating. The area around us can
dictate our behaviors and actions, use this major influence to your advantage
to drive change.

**Motivating the elephant** provides steps to direct and encourage our
subconscious into action. To do this it is advised to trigger an emotional
response to the change, don't just dictate it, make it easy for people to connect
with it. Shrink the change and make success easy, start small and introduce
early wins to stimulate motivation. And finally grow your people, help people
form a self image that is consistent with the goal so they feel motivated to be
consistent with their image.

Not only does the book go deep into each of these topics. Dan and Chip teach
the content through story telling. The whole book is rich with case studies,
academic research stories and personal experiences making many of the points
more memorable.
