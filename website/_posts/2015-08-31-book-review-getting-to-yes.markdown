The traditional form of negotiation follows the painful dance of both parties
deciding what they want, stating what their position is and then making small
compromises until both are happy with the agreed upon outcome. The problem with
this form of negotiation is that inevitably leaves one party feeling hard done
by and the other exhausted or guilty after the bending the other party to their
will.

This traditional form of negotiation is known as "Negotiating over a Position".
Once two parties have stated their positions, such as "I will not pay more than
20 dollars for this" and "this product will not be sold for less than $50". We
have already backed ourselves into corners and have only given our counter
party the information to argue over the number - rather than understand why we
believe it is worth $20 or $50 dollars and what could be done to satisfy the
underlying interests that are supporting our stated positions.

[Getting to Yes](http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Yes-Negotiating-Agreement-Without/dp/0140157352)
provides a simple set of four steps to apply to any negotiation
scenario to help achieve an outcome that both parties can be satisfied with and
that explores all options.

The book starts out by describing the problem of "Negotiating over a Position"
and then goes on to explain the two typical roles in this negotiation,
hard and soft.

1. **When being Hard over a position** you are typically left tired and exhausted
   from holding out for so long and your team is probably burning out.
2. **When being Soft over a position** you are typically left feeling hard done
   by or you feel cheated as you have made more concessions than you were
   comfortable with.

Rather than negotiate using this format. Roger Fisher and William Ury suggest
that you should instead employ the following techniques:

1. Separate people from the problem
1. Focus on interests not positions
2. Invent options for mutual gain
1. Insist on using objective criteria

By employing these techniques to a negotiation, you are better able to **put emotion
away from the problem** and look at it objectively by not confusing it with the
person. By **focusing on interests**, you can resist the natural reaction to argue
over someones position and you are encouraged to look past and understand what
their underlying interests are. **Inventing options** allows you to explore
opportunities that can satisfy both parties interests in novel ways. And
finally, by using **objective criteria** you can be assured that you are both
reaching an agreement that is fair and unbiased to personal opinion or
preference.
