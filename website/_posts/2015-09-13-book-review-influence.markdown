[Influence by Robert B. Cialdini](http://google.com) is one of my all time
favorite books. After reading it, it changed the way I looked at everyday
interactions. 

The insights Cialdini shares are truly valuable. Everyday, during our common
interactions we are naturally influenced by certain things. We are usually
oblivious to what these influences are but we usually feel them afterwards.  It
might be during a negotiation for a car, after the purchase of an item or after
following someone's less than helpful instructions.

Cialdini and his years of research have distilled down these influences into
six clear principles. What I appreciate the most from this book is that he is
not sharing his gut feelings or observations but he is sharing years of
academic research by him and his peers.

The six principles that Cialdini has identified are, **Reciprocation**,
**Commitment and Consistency**, **Social Proof**, **Liking**, **Authority** and
**Scarcity**. Below are my rough notes.

1. **Reciprocation**
  - People like to return the favour and often return favors at levels
    exceeding the initial favour or gift
  - Christmas cards sent to randoms, people replied with cards
  - People feel indebted, the feeling results in over compensation

2. **Commitment and Consistency**
  - People like to be consistent in their actions and words
  - Private and public consistency matters, the latter more
      - Written > Spoken > Thoughts

3. **Social Proof**
  - People often look to see what others are doing as evidence for what they
    should be doing
  - When there is an accident people look to see how others are behaving and
    reacting and look to their surroundings for guidance

4. **Liking**
  - People are influenced by people they like
  - Attractiveness matters, people like people they are attracted too
  - People like people that are similar to them
  - Honest compliments, make people like someone
  - Contact and cooperation creates a bond
  - Conditioning and association with things can result in liking, for instance
    people of respectable positions in companies, celebrities, status

5. **Authority**
  - People of authoritative positions command influence
  - Connotation not context, actors who play roles as doctors are respected as
    doctors
  - Titles, people with titles in front of their name receive recognition, for
    instance people are less likely to argue with someone who is a PhD doctor,
    even in the field they donâ€™t have the PhD in
  - Clothes, uniforms and outfits can command authority and have influence,
    suites a tie
  - Trappings, expensive vehicles and accessories can command authority

6. **Scarcity**
  - Mormon temple was only going to be open for a few more days, people became
    desperate to go on the tour even though they have zero interest, simply
    because it was their only opportunity, scarcity principle
  - People psychologically want something that is of limited availability
