Breakthrough Rapid Reading by Peter Kump was a great read. Reading is a skill
that if you invest in and learn well, will pay you back many times over. What I
have found most beneficial from investing in my reading is that my massive list
of articles and books I'd like to read no longer feel unsurmountable. I now
have the skills to get through that list in a reasonable time. And as
experience from the last few months has proven to me, it has really helped.

This book wasn't read in the hopes of becoming a 100 page a minute speed reader
but instead to increase my reading pace to allow me to healthily get through my
reading list and to generally be more comfortable reading through large bodies
of information at a good pace.

Within the book there are several great tips - some of my key takeaways were:

* For more technical books, reading fast may not be desirable, you need to take
  the time to digest and understand the material and information being
  presented, while you may be able to consume information to really comprehend
  you may have to slow down and allow your mind to digest what you are reading.
* Turn of your inner voice trying to read out aloud what you are reading, this
  will hold you back and prevent you from reaching higher speeds.
* Practice passing your eyes over sentences, reading each word but practice
  moving fast - ensuring you are comprehending what you are seeing. After a
  short period of time it is worth stopping and reflecting back about what you
  just read - did you remember it? Quiz yourself, try draw a mind map of what
  you have just seen. For me it helps to think that I am "seeing" the text and
  not "reading" it, however when I am seeing it, I am comprehending it.

Apart from those above take aways, the book had a lot of exercises that are
worth working through and internalizing. Rapid reading doesn't happen over
night but with quality practice can get a lot faster over time.
