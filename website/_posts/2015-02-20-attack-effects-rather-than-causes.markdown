Below is a fantastic quote I came across when reading [The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance by
Robert

Whether it is [Taiichi Ohno and Toyota Production
System](http://www.amazon.com/Toyota-Production-System-Beyond-Large-Scale/dp/0915299143)
- urging workers to address problems at their root cause, [Peter Senge in The

- asserting that to resolve a problem the problem needs to be addressed in terms
of a whole system and not just the immediately observable parts of the sub
system, or whether it is me - [blogging about the root problem](

again. 

Of all the quotes I have come across on this topic though, this quote
by Robert Pirsig is one of the best
