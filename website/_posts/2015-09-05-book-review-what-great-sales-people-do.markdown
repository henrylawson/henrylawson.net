[What great sales people
do](http://amzn.to/2fNfzeG)
by Ben Zoldan and Michael Bosworth was a good read on selling through the use
of emotional connection by listening and sharing stories.

Much of the content in the book is focused around the art of sharing stories
and being able to connect and resonate with buyers, leading them through the
sales process through story telling.

The material presented in the book is general enough that I think it is
applicable not just in sales but in  the common act of sharing and
communicating ideas in a persuasive manner.

The book presents a common framework for story building by defining a
**Setting**, **Complication**, **Turning Point** and **Resolution**. The
framework that they present, named the **Story Leaders Card System**, assigns a
colored card to each topic and guides you through the thought process of
constructing a story that has each of these aspects.

With this framework you are encouraged to build stories about your product to
assist in moving customers through the sales ladder and also to create stories
about yourself to answer questions such as:

- Who I am?
- Who I represent?
- Who I've helped?

The book rounds out at the end by emphasizing the importance of **empathic
listening** presenting the model of **Awareness**, **Encouragement** and
**Reflection**. Highlighting the importance to allow your customer to speak
and for you to understand what it is they are saying with their verbal and
non verbal cues.

Finally the book covers the topic of selling to a large organisation and talks
about the [model of
adoption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_adoption_lifecycle) and the
importance of having stories that are viral enough that key people in the
organisation begin telling and inevitably sell for you. To do this they use the
analogy of **Story Teller**, **Tribal Leader** and **Tribes**.
