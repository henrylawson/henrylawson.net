title: Book Review - The Fifth Discipline

Having heard a lot recently about [Systems
Thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_thinking), I thought it best to re
prioritize my reading list and place some popular Systems thinking books at the
top of my list. One of those books was
[The Fifth
Discipline by Peter Senge](http://amzn.to/2eapiLK).

<!--more-->

The Fifth Discipline was a light and practical read. It described in detail what Systems
Thinking is, how it relates to
the [Learning Organization](
https://hbr.org/2008/03/is-yours-a-learning-organization)
and the other 4 key disciplines (noted below) of a Learning Organization.

Reading through the book I did feel that many of the ideas in Systems Thinking
overlaps greatly with what I had learned from lean principles, I didn't feel
that the ideas were new to me but I did find it very valuable to see similar
ideas presented from another view point. I also liked the language used when
talking about systems thinking, [Dynamic vs. Detail Complexity](

[Reinforcing vs. Balancing Feedback](
{% post_url 2015-07-05-reinforcing-vs-balancing-feedback %}),
[Circles of Causality](
{% post_url 2015-07-05-circle-of-causality %}) and
[Delays in Systems]({% post_url 2015-07-05-delays-in-systems %}).

The five disciplines that Senge refers to with regard to a learning
organization in the book are:

1. **Personal mastery** looking at reality objectively, deepening our personal
   vision, developing patience, a personal dedication to continuous focus,
   learning and growth.
1. **Building shared vision**, ensuring the organisation has one shared goal
   that was created by those in the team and not dictated to them by a
   committee.
1. **Mental models**, the constructs in our mind that enable us to make
   decisions and take action, how we arrive at answers and solutions.
1. **Team learning**, prefer dialogue to allow a team to learn and evolve and
   improve their practices, in lean this is the defining a process and
   improving the process, working together collaborating, leaving titles at the
   door and letting people identify and find ways to improve together.
1. **Systems thinking**, the concept of looking at the entire picture and how
   behaviors and actions feed back into the system and cause effects.

I also liked the commentary on the discussion of the [Beer
Game](http://supplychain.mit.edu/supply-chain-games/beer-game/).  The Beer Game
is an activity conducted in MIT to teach supply chain management to students.
It highlights to participants the consequences of thinking and acting as
individuals and for the best interests of a subsystem. The game is good because
it is able to show how all of those individual decisions and actions that
appeared to be optimal for the subsystem were actually less then ideal for the
whole system, emphasizing the importance for Systems Thinking, it is also
a great example of [Detail Complexity](

Overall the book was a great read and taught me a lot of new language and
thinking that can be applied in day to day life as well as business.
