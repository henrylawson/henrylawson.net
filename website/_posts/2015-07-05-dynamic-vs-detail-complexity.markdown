title: Dynamic vs. Detail Complexity

[Peter Senge, in The Fifth Discipline](
{% post_url 2015-07-05-book-review-the-fifth-discipline %}) defines two types 
of complexity. Dynamic and Detail complexity.

Detail Complexity is defined in the book as 'the complexity in which there
are many variables'.

The whole quote is below:

[Researching more into what this
means](https://hbr.org/2013/09/our-self-inflicted-complexity/) I have come to
understand that Detail Complexity is simply a category for complexity where
there are lots of variables or moving parts involved.

Dynamic Complexity, on the other hand is a category for complexity where the
_cause_ and _effects_ are more subtle - the _effect_ is not immediately obvious
at the time the _cause_ is introduced, however over time as several _causes_
build up and the _effect_ becomes more obvious. A good example is revealed to
players of the [Beer
Game](http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2012/manufacturing-beer-game-0503).

A good quote from the book is below:

> The second type is dynamic complexity, situations where cause and effect are
> subtle and where the effects over time of interventions are not obvious.
> Conventional forecasting, planning and analysis methods are not equipped to
> deal with dynamic complexity. The real leverage in most management situations
> lies in understanding dynamic complexity not detail complexity.  **Peter
> Senge (The Fifth Discipline)**

When dealing with complexity it is important to be able to distinguish and
categorize the two, so that the right solution can be applied. Dynamic
Complexity, by its' nature is harder to see but having an awareness of what it
is and how it can manifest can help address it.
