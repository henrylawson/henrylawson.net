[Peter Senge, in The Fifth Discipline](
{% post_url 2015-07-05-book-review-the-fifth-discipline %}) defines two types
of feedback. Reinforcing and Balancing Feedback.

<!--more-->

These two forms of feedback are typically expressed in terms of a loop, the
feedback is invested back into the system forming [Circles of Causality](
{% post_url 2015-07-05-circle-of-causality %}). This is
the basic idea of Systems Thinking, that every action triggers reactions, that
trigger further actions. Forming a circle of causality.

**Reinforcing Feedback is that which accelerates change in a system towards a
positive or negative trend**. Positively Reinforcing Feedback is what is
typically desired, some examples might be viral videos, or in Agile development
if done well the regular practice (action) of retrospectives and stand-ups can
have a positively trending effect through process improvement (reactions).
These practices are a good example because these actions when poorly done can
also have a negative trend.

**Balancing Feedback is that which maintains the system in a stable state**.  This
can be a good or bad thing - depending if there is a desired change to be done
to the system. An example might be a failed change program in an organisation -
a change program typically fails because there is a strong balancing feedback
loop present in the system that is auto correcting itself to maintain the
current state. This may be due to the attitudes and goals of the system and a
failure for the change program to target the correct causes.
