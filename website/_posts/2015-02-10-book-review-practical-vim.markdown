[Practical Vim by Drew Neil](https://pragprog.com/book/dnvim/practical-vim) has
been very helpful on my journey to learning how to use Vim. The book started by
giving a nice overview on the Vim way, different modes in Vim, handling files
and moving around.

What I found most helpful is that by leveraging Drew's experience and knowledge
in Vim I could learn quickly what the basic and fundamental ways to use Vim
are. The same learning's can be gained by reading the manual, watching screen
casts but I enjoyed the written format as I could read a chapter, let it
digest, and continue using Vim. After some time and having become comfortable
with what was taught I would then move onto the next concept.

Another great learning from his book was understanding the "Vim Way", its
concepts and terminology. This formed a strong base for me to then look
into the documentation to solve problems for myself or to get a deeper
understanding. Prior to reading this book, the documentation was a little
daunting.

I am by no means done with my Vim learning journey I still have a long way to
go but this book was very helpful in laying down the basics of what is needed.
