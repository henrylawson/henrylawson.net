[The Challenger Sale
](http://www.amazon.com/The-Challenger-Sale-Customer-Conversation/dp/1591844355)
was another great read on sales and sales tactics. Similar to [SPIN 
Selling]({% post_url 2015-08-30-book-review-spin-selling %}),
it focused on the interactions and discussions with the customer and how to
approach and nurture the relationship for success.

The book is based on a study of an organisation and the information and advice
the book provides is based on the learning's and findings from the authors
research.

In their research, authors Matthew and Brent discovered five types of sales
workers, these are:

1. The challenger
1. The hard worker
1. The relationship builder
1. The lone wolf
1. The reactive problem solver

They then studied these types of sales workers to understand which approach
lead to the most success. Their finding was that the first type, **The
Challenger**, was most successful.

When they deconstructed what actions these sales workers were taking and found
a set of actions they called **Constructive Tension**, challenger sales
workers, **taught for differentiation**, **took control of the sale** and
**tailored their messages for resonance**. All of these actions kept the
customer engaged and positioned the sales worker and his organisation as
knowledgeable experts who understood their customers business.

**Teaching for differentiation** involved providing insights to their customers
on industry trends, unique perspectives, compelling industry issues, potential
land minds, etc. The sales workers would use these insights to lead
conversations and lead towards solutions and implementations. Conversations
such as these, also help to create a sense of urgency for the customer and
their organisation to act on this information.

**Tailoring for resonance** is about ensuring that the message or insights
being shared are framed and relevant to the customers being pitched too.
Challenger sales workers need to understand the buying influences of the
customer, their needs and desires and tailor the message to have an impact
on them.

**Taking control of the sale**, contrary to what it's name might suggest, it is
not about being aggressive towards the customer in moving them through the
sales process. Instead it means to plan purposefully, planning for and
anticipating questions, preparing answers in advance, knowing the client, being
prepared for the negotiation and to avoid pitfalls such as discussing cost and
money too early without first setting an understanding of value and without
understanding why cost is important to the customer.

Overall the book provided some great insights into the customer interaction and
provided some solid advice on how to approach and execute the conversation.
