[Getting Past No by William
Ury](http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Past-Negotiating-Difficult-Situations/dp/0553371312)
built on some of the ideas presented in [Getting To Yes]({% post_url 2015-08-31-book-review-getting-to-yes %}).
The book went deeper on the topic of
dealing with a difficult counter party who has immediately taken the position
of "No" in an argument.

In a simple to follow formula, Ury has laid out 5 steps to the deal with this
situation in a negotiation.

The first thing is to **not react**. When dealing with a person who has taken a
strong position. It best to first control your feelings and not become
emotional. If the behavior of your counter party is offensive or triggers your
emotions, pause for a moment and allow your self to collect your thoughts.

Once collected, begin **disarming your opponent** by stepping to their side.
Listen to them, ask clarifying questions, paraphrase statements and focus on
areas of agreement, build on common ground.

After the conversation has returned to a productive level, **change the game**.
Start understanding what their interests are. Most likely they have only
shared their problems. Now it is time to understand what their underlying
interests are. Ask clarifying questions, the "Why" and "Why not".

**Make it easy for them to say yes** and **hard for them to say no** by
removing obstacles that prevent agreement, offering multiple choices and
building with them on the options that they find agreeable, share credit to
reach a solution and ensure that they do not lose face in the agreement. If
they continue to show resistance, reemphasize the importance to reach an
agreement, share previous agreed upon items and consider sharing your BATNA in
a none threatening way.
