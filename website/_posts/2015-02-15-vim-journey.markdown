Learning Vim is a fun and fulfilling journey that has been worth the initial
small amount of pain, to learn Vim I have found the following activities
helpful:

<!--more-->

1. Play [vimtutor](http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/vimtutor1.html), finish
   it, it doesn't take too long
1. Start with a blank vimrc, slowly customize the basic settings to your liking
1. Once you are happy with your basic customization's, start learning various
   movements to allow you to get around
1. Use Vim in all opportunities, have your old editor available to fall back
   to but try use Vim as much as possible, if you get stuck there is no harm in
   stopping, using your old editor and returning back to Vim when you are more
   patient and not feeling pressured
1. Consider using [MacVim](https://github.com/b4winckler/macvim) or some
   other equivalent, it makes transitioning easier as it allows you interact
   with Vim more naturally, using your mouse and scroll wheel, copy paste
   etc. This will help ease the transition.
1. Open all sorts of files in Vim, README's, documentation, anything - I have
   my Vim configured so beautifully it is a real pleasure to look at code and
   documentation in it, I think this has really helped be use Vim more.
1. Start improving your vimrc, customizing it is a lot of fun, use
   [NeoBundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim), checkout
   [vimawesome](http://vimawesome.com/), [vimcolor](http://vimcolors.com/) and
   make your Vim stylish - avoid adding too many custom shortcuts though -
   stick to the defaults as much as you can
1. Read [Practical Vim]({% post_url 2015-02-10-book-review-practical-vim %})
   and build your base knowledge stronger
1. Get by with the basic motions and shortcuts but once comfortable always
   search and look for a better way to do it, you can get by with the arrow
   keys, i and esc but you need to keep looking for better ways to improve your
   process
1. Once you are more comfortable, remove your fear of the default Vim
   documentation, it really is the best resource
1. Look at others vimrc or dotvim files on Github for inspiration on how to
   customize yours

Learning and being comfortable in Vim has and is taking me a long time but I
have found it very much worth the effort, the pleasure of working in a fast
responsive editor that feels simple but is very powerful has added joy back
into writing, and reading text.

[My dotvim configuration is available on
Github](https://github.com/henrylawson/dotvim).
