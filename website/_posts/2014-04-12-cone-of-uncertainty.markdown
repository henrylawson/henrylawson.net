The **cone of uncertainty** is a great diagram to explain the **level of confidence
that a software development team typically has at various stages of a project**.
What I like the most about the diagram is that it clearly depicts that **at the
start of the project, a lot is unknown**. The initial learning's and analysis at
the start of the project assists greatly in reducing that uncertainty
but it never removes all uncertainty (it never reaches zero). Even after the
initial drop of uncertainty during the early analysis phase the graph is
still far from zero.

The **cone of uncertainty** is a good tool to help explain that perfect
planning is a fallacy, an unachievable goal - simply because there is too much
uncertainty at the start of a project. **The only way to remove that uncertainty
is to continue forward and learn more**.

What teams often forget and fail to acknowledge is that once the planning or
**early analysis phase has concluded, there is still a large amount of
uncertainty that still needs to be managed**.

Presenting this diagram at the start of the project can be helpful to set
expectations about how confident stakeholders and the team should be with
estimates around dates, scope and budget. It can also be helpful to
periodically revisit the diagram to see how the team is trending. If the
**project is progressing along the x-axis and certainty is not reducing, this can
be an early indicator that something is going wrong** and there are some issues
to be addressed, addressing these issues can be done through a Five Why
activity.
