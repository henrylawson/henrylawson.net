title: Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Study Plan
date: 2017-01-29
---

Recently, for various reasons, my interest in [Google Cloud Platform
(GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/) has peaked.  I have had exposure to [Amazon
Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/) and as such am fairly comfortable
with their offering, platform and services. However I have not had the chance
to be exposed to the same level to GCP.

Below is a plan I have put together to help improve my knowledge of GCP, it is
quite thorough, I don't intend on getting through all of it but it is a plan to
get the ball rolling.

1. Connect with the public community, go over popular content:
  1. [GCP Podcasts](https://www.gcppodcast.com/)
  1. [GCP Blog](https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/)
  1. [GCP Medium posts](https://medium.com/google-cloud)
  1. [GCP Twitter](https://twitter.com/googlecloud)
  1. [GCP StackOverflow and SeverFault](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/3466163?hl=en)
  1. [Google Groups Mailing lists](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/3466163?hl=en)
  1. [GCP public GitHub repos](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/3466163?hl=en)
  1. Follow GCP developer advocates - twitter, medium, blogs
  1. Follow any popular non googler GCP - twitter, medium, blogs
  1. [GCP YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/googlecloudplatform/)
1. Search for any books on GCP or GCP products, add them to reading list
  1. [Google Cloud Platform in Action](http://amzn.to/2jiqmzS)
  1. [Site Reliability Engineering](http://amzn.to/2kfFDjZ)
1. Review the certifications and study guides, record resources for deeper learning later
  1. [Cloud Architect](https://cloud.google.com/certification/cloud-architect)
  1. [Data Engineer](https://cloud.google.com/certification/data-engineer)
1. [Read over to a shallow depth GCP's services and offerings](https://cloud.google.com/products)
1. Compare and contrast popular cloud offerings, identify gaps strengths
  1. [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/)
  1. [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/products/)
1. Rank GCP services by ubiquity and begin studying and building with them
  1. For each service:
    1. Read over marketing content, client stories, GCP website pitch
    1. Read over GCP documentation
    1. Identity and watch any popular GCP or third party how-to videos or tech
       talks on the product, GCP Next vids, udemy, quicklabs, safari books
       online, google code labs etc.
    1. Configure using GCP web console
    1. Configure using GCP API
    1. Configure using GCP Cloud Deployment Manager
    1. Go over configuring service with Terraform, Puppet, Chef, Salt
       understand maturity and flexibility of integration with GCP or third
       party products/clouds, are any features missing etc.
    1. Determine how product integrates with other GCP products, IAM, Load
       Balancers etc. integrate and try, understand best practices and
       improvements
    1. Contrast experience with AWS/Azure equivalent product
    1. Analyse the "business and tech problems" this product can help solve
    1. Determine the elevator pitch for this service
    1. How can it be used by a development team in DEV, UAT, PROD; how can
       config and changes be promoted through environments, think through
       scenarios and devise answers
    1. How can it be tested?, can the testing be automated?
    1. How is it monitored? what can be monitored?
    1. How is it secured? how can a large organisation isolate and provide this
       service to teams? with manageable blast radiuses?
    1. How can it be configured to be highly available?
    1. What does the "perfect setup/best practice" look like for an enterprise
       organisation?
    1. How is the billing formulated? how can the cost be reduced by users?
