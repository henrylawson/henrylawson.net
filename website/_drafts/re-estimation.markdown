A common debate I have had in a lot of teams is when to re estimate story points. To answer this we have to remember what story points are. **Story points** are measurements of the **overall size and complexity** of a feature being implemented **relative to the other features**. Story points are not estimates for the time it would take to develop the feature. It is however a function of time that may have a linear or non-linear relationship to points. It is important then to not use the time it took to complete a story to justify a re estimation. The reason being that the mental function that is used to determine that story point estimation from time is at best only based on the knowledge you have of the completed estimated stories, their function to time will most likely fluctuate throughout the project.
